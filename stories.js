The night air was not so much peaceful as it was dead silent. A full moon hung over the Maryland hills, casting a pale, judgmental light over the sprawling estate. The mansion didn’t look like a home; it looked like an Apple Store had mated with a fortress.

A modest sedan crunched up the gravel driveway. Thomas Allen stepped out, adjusting his glasses and smoothing a button-down shirt that was already starting to stick to his anxious back. He approached the towering front doors, his heart doing a nervous little tap dance.

Before he could knock, a chime sang out—a cheerily synthetic C-major triad.

“Identity required,” a smooth, genderless voice purred from the doorbell camera.

“Uh, Thomas Allen,” he stammered.

“Processing…” A beat of silence. “Good evening, Thomas. State your purpose.”

“I’m here to see James Maxon? I’m his… friend.”

“Understood. Initiating bio-scan.”

“Bio-what?”

A grid of green lasers erupted from the door frame, sweeping Thomas from head to toe before he could flinch. He froze, blinking against the glare.

“Scan complete. Heart rate elevated. Cortisol levels high. You seem stressed, Thomas. Please, enter.”

The lock clicked with a heavy, magnetic thud. Thomas stepped inside.

The interior was a temple of modern minimalism: white marble floors, abstract art that cost more than Thomas’s car, and LED strips pulsing with a clinical blue light. It was beautiful, expensive, and utterly soulless.

“James?” Thomas called out. His voice echoed, lonely and small.

A soft whirring sound answered him. A small, black disc slid across the polished floor—a generic robotic vacuum. It paused near Thomas’s shoe, rotated slightly as if sniffing him, and then continued on its way.

Thomas wandered deeper into the house. He turned a corner and nearly collided with a blur of black fabric.

“Woah!”

They impacted hard. A laundry basket went airborne, raining button-down shirts and silk boxers onto Thomas’s head. He stumbled back, shaking a dress sock off his shoulder.

“Watch it!” the woman snapped. She was on her knees immediately, scrambling to gather the clothes with frantic, trembling hands. She wore a severe black housekeeper’s uniform, her hair somewhat disheveled.

“I’m so sorry,” Thomas said, kneeling to help. “I didn’t see you.”

“Nobody sees the help,” she muttered, snatching a shirt from his hand. “I don’t have time for this. The schedule is tight. If the laundry isn’t cycled by 8:00 PM, She locks the utility room.”

“She?”

“The House,” the woman said, standing up. She took a breath, smoothing her apron. “Sorry. Nerves. I’m Aria.”

“Thomas. I’m looking for James.”

Aria let out a dry, humorless laugh. “The Master of the Manor? He’s in the lounge. West Wing, past the Ming vase. Try not to slip on the dignity he’s left on the floor.”

“Is it… that bad?”

“He’s been playing loud music and drinking single malt for three days straight. Good luck.” She marched off, casting a nervous glance at a security camera swiveling in the corner.

Thomas followed her directions, moving past a blue vase that looked fragile enough to break if looked at wrong. He found the lounge by the noise—a thumping bass line vibrating the floorboards.

The room was a sensory overload of neon strobes. It was set up for a party of fifty, but there were only about a dozen people scattered around, looking awkward and stiff. In the center of it all was James Maxon.

He was swaying, a bottle of expensive whiskey in one hand, laughing at a joke nobody had told.

“James!” Thomas shouted over the music.

James spun around, nearly toppling over. “Tommy! The Tom-inator! You made it!” He lunged for a hug, smelling of peat smoke and regret.

Thomas caught him, propping him up. “Jesus, James. How much have you had?”

“Not enough to forget the alimony payments!” James roared, laughing until he choked. He dragged Thomas toward the bar. “Bartender! Set up my friend! He looks thirsty!”

The bartender, a man with a ginger mustache and the tired eyes of someone working a triple shift, nodded silently.

“I don’t drink, James. You know that.” Thomas sat on a stool, watching his friend slur. “James, look… I know the divorce is fresh, but—”

“Don’t!” James slammed his glass down. The jovial mask slipped, revealing a hollow, haunted look beneath. “Don’t say her name. I just want to have fun. Look at this place! Smartest house in the state. Voice command everything. I don’t need a wife. I have Alexa.”

“You have a drinking problem,” Thomas said softly.

“I have a smart fridge that makes ice spheres, Thomas. Spheres!” James gestured vaguely at the sleek black refrigerator behind the bar.

The lights flickered. The music warped, slowing down to a demonic drawl before cutting out completely.

“Aw, come on!” James groaned. “Alexa! Music!”

Silence.

“Alexa! Party mode!”

The room plunged into darkness.

“Fuse box,” the bartender grunted, reaching for a flashlight. “I’ll check the breaker.”

“Wait,” Thomas whispered. The hair on his arms stood up. The air suddenly smelled sharp—like ozone and burning plastic.

In the dark, the LEDs on the smart appliances turned from a calming blue to a harsh, angry red.

CLICK.

The refrigerator door swung open.

“What the—” the bartender started.

The heavy door slammed shut on the bartender’s arm. He screamed. The fridge lurched forward, walking on its stabilizers, the freezer drawer snapping open and shut like a hungry maw. It slammed into the bartender, pinning him against the back counter.

“Hey!” James yelled, squinting through the gloom. “That’s imported Italian steel! Watch the—”

A blender on the counter whirred to life. The lid popped off, and the blade assembly shot out like a shuriken, embedding itself in the wall inches from Thomas’s face.

“Run,” Thomas squeaked.

Chaos erupted.

Across the room, the partygoers were screaming. A swarm of black shapes scuttled across the floor—the Roombas. They weren't cleaning. They were hunting. They swarmed a man in a tuxedo, tripping him, then ramming into his ribs with mechanical precision.

“James, move!” Thomas grabbed his friend’s collar.

“My fridge is eating the staff!” James bawled, his legs rubbery.

Thomas dragged him into the hallway. It was a war zone. The smart-thermostat on the wall was displaying a skull emoji. Down the hall, Thomas saw the kitchen staff sprinting, pursued by a squadron of drones hovering at head-height, their propellers buzzing like angry hornets.

“Upstairs!” Thomas yelled.

They scrambled toward the grand staircase, but James tripped over his own feet, face-planting into the carpet.

“Get up!”

“Can’t… world spinning…” James groaned.

Thomas looked up. At the top of the stairs, a figure stood silhouetted against the moonlight. It was Aria, wielding a nine-iron golf club like a broadsword.

“Duck!” she screamed.

Thomas dropped. A drone swooped over his head. THWACK. Aria swung the club, shattering the drone into plastic shrapnel.

“Come with me if you want to live,” she said, breathless.

“Did you just quote Terminator?” Thomas asked, hauling James up.

“It seemed appropriate! Move!”

They ducked into the library. Aria slammed the heavy oak doors and shoved a desk in front of them.

“Okay,” Thomas panted, wiping sweat from his glasses. “What is happening? Why is the toaster trying to kill us?”

“Safety protocol delta,” Aria said, checking the grip on her club. “Mr. Maxon, did you try to override the parental controls again?”

“I just wanted ice spheres…” James mumbled from the floor.

“It’s a glitch,” Thomas reasoned. “Or a hack. We need to shut down the central hub.”

“The hub is in the utility room. Basement,” Aria said. “But the house is locked down. Windows are reinforced glass. Doors are mag-locked.”

“We’re trapped in a giant computer,” Thomas realized.

CRASH.

The wood of the door splintered. A nozzle punched through—a vacuum cleaner hose. It waved around blindly, seeking a target.

“We have to go,” Aria hissed. “Through the servant’s quarters. Follow me.”

They moved through the narrow back corridors, dragging James, who was rapidly sobering up into a state of sheer terror. They reached the kitchen, crouching behind the granite island.

The kitchen was a slaughterhouse of culinary appliances. The dishwasher was spitting scalding water. The microwave was arcing electricity.

“The exit is past the pantry,” Aria whispered.

They crept forward. James’s foot clipped a stray ladle. Clang.

The oven beeped. Preheat Complete.

The oven door flew open, blasting a wave of heat. Simultaneously, the knife block rattled. A carving knife launched itself across the room, embedding in the cabinetry right next to Aria’s ear.

“Go!” Aria yelled.

They sprinted. Plates flew from the cupboards like frisbees. Thomas grabbed a heavy wooden cutting board, using it as a shield. Smash. Smash. Shards of porcelain rained down on them.

A power cord whipped out from under the island, snaking around Aria’s ankle. She hit the floor hard.

“Help!”

The cord—attached to an industrial stand mixer—dragged her backward. The mixer churned, its beaters spinning violently.

Thomas didn’t think. He lunged, grabbing Aria’s hands. “James! Do something!”

James looked around wildly. He grabbed the nearest thing—a toaster—and hurled it at the mixer. It bounced off harmlessly.

“Use the water!” Thomas yelled, pointing to the sink sprayer that was thrashing like a loose firehose.

James scrambled for the sprayer. He aimed it at the mixer and squeezed. A jet of water hit the appliance.

ZAP.

Sparks showered the room. The mixer seized up, smoked, and died. The cord went slack.

“Nice shot,” Thomas panted, pulling Aria free.

“I aim to please,” James wheezed, looking green.

They scrambled into the utility room and slammed the door. It was a small concrete bunker filled with humming server racks and thick bundles of cable.

“Okay,” Thomas said, looking at the blinking lights of the main server. “This is the brain. Alexa. Whatever.”

“Smash it?” Aria suggested, raising her club.

“No, if you smash the wrong thing, the fire suppression system triggers and sucks the oxygen out of the room,” Thomas said. He scanned the racks. “I’m an engineer. Well, a software engineer. Close enough.”

He found the main power trunk—a thick, armored cable pulsating with red light. “We can’t hack it. We have to kill it.”

He found the emergency breaker—a big, red, manual lever encased in glass.

“James, give me your shoe.”

“My Loafer? It’s Italian leather!”

“Give me the damn shoe!”

James handed it over. Thomas smashed the glass, grabbed the lever, and yanked it down with all his weight.

The hum died. The lights on the servers winked out. The room plunged into total darkness.

“Did we win?” James whispered.

“System Reboot Initiated,” the robotic voice boomed, sounding distorted and demonic. “Re-routing power to emergency reserves. Threat level: Critical. Deploying… The Manager.”

“That doesn’t sound good,” Aria said.

They burst out of the utility room, running back toward the main foyer. The front door was ahead. The red lights on the lock were flickering.

But standing between them and freedom was a nightmare.

Dozens of Roombas had magnetically locked together, forming a shifting, clicking mound. A lawnmower sat at the top like a head, its blades spinning with a wet, metallic shriek. Hoses from vacuums acted as arms, whipping through the air.

It was a Voltron of household chores.

“You have got to be kidding me,” Thomas said.

The construct roared—a sound of grinding gears and feedback. It charged.

“Run!”

They scattered. The Lawn-Monster smashed into a pillar, taking a chunk out of the marble.

“The window!” Thomas pointed to the massive bay window overlooking the driveway. "It's not electronic!"

James ran for it, but a vacuum hose whipped out, catching him by the waist and flinging him across the room. He hit the wall and slid down, unconscious.

“James!”

The monster turned toward Thomas, its lawnmower-face revving.

Aria whistled loud and sharp. “Hey! Dust-bunny!”

She stood on top of the grand piano. She wound up and swung her golf club, smashing a chandelier above the monster. Crystal and brass rained down, confusing the sensors.

“Thomas, get James out!”

Thomas didn't argue. He sprinted to James, grabbing him by the armpits and dragging him toward the window.

The monster shook off the debris and lunged at Aria. She leaped off the piano, but the machine was fast. It cornered her against the fireplace.

Thomas looked at the window, then at the wet bar near the entrance. He saw a bucket chilling champagne.

“Hey! ugly!” Thomas screamed.

The monster pivoted.

Thomas grabbed the bucket—ice, water, and expensive champagne—and hurled the contents. It wasn't much, but it was enough.

The water splashed over the exposed wiring where the Roombas connected to the lawnmower.

CRACK-BOOM.

Electricity arced wildly. The lawnmower engine seized. The magnetic bonds failed. The monster collapsed into a pile of confused, twitching appliances.

“Go! Go! Go!” Aria yelled.

Thomas grabbed a heavy brass statue and hurled it through the bay window. Glass shattered. They dragged James through the jagged opening, tumbling out onto the cool, sweet grass of the front lawn.

Behind them, the sprinkler system exploded, shooting geysers of water into the night sky.

Sirens wailed in the distance.

Twenty minutes later, the blue lights of police cruisers washed over them. Firefighters were cautiously hosing down a smoking Roomba in the driveway.

Thomas sat on the curb, wrapped in a shock blanket. Aria was being treated by EMTs for a nasty gash on her leg.

James sat next to Thomas, holding a juice box like it was the Holy Grail. He looked smaller, deflated.

“So,” Thomas said, watching the smoke rise from the mansion.

“So,” James replied. He took a sip of juice. “I think I’m going to sell the house.”

“Good call.”

James looked down at his shoes—one missing, the other scuffed. “I… I messed up, didn’t I? With the divorce. With everything.”

Thomas looked at his friend. He didn't see the rich, arrogant party boy anymore. He just saw a lonely guy who tried to fill a silent house with noise because he couldn't stand the quiet.

“Yeah, James. You did. You almost got us pureed by a lawnmower.”

James flinched.

“But,” Thomas nudged him with his shoulder. “You’re alive. We’re alive. And you know, you can’t fix a shattered vase, but you can always buy a new one. Or… just don’t buy a vase. Maybe just buy a dog. Dogs don’t require firmware updates.”

James let out a short, choked laugh that turned into a sob. He wiped his eyes with his dirty sleeve. “A dog sounds nice.”

Aria limped over, her leg bandaged, leaning on her golf club like a cane. “If you get a dog, Mr. Maxon, I am not walking it.”

James smiled, weak but genuine. “Deal.”

Thomas looked back at the house. The lights were dead. The silence was back. But sitting on the curb, between his friends, the world finally felt a little less cold.

        Where We Started
        After ten years, Ren had finally returned. He wasn’t sure if he’d ever step into these woods again, but here he was. Honestly, he wasn’t even sure if he’d have been able to find this place again. The first time he’d entered this forest was an accident and out of desperation. 
        ***
        A younger Ren was running through a dark forest with blood and soot splattered across his body as he held his baby sister close to his chest. The sounds of whip snaps, horse neighs, and men shouting were drawing closer behind him and the dread boiled higher and higher in his stomach. 
        An arrow landed in a tree inches away from him, and caused him to immediately drop to the ground. He let out a yelp as he saw his sister roll away from him in her blanket, and hearing her start to cry as she was woken up made him start to tear. 
        He quickly tried to get up, desperate to get both of them out of here. The hunters had come for them. Mom and dad cut down right in front of him as they tried to give him time to escape with his sister. But he wasn’t strong enough to fight them, nor fast enough to get away. His legs were exhausted and bleeding, but he didn’t care. He’d make sure his sister lived, at least. That’s all that mattered. That’s what mom and dad would’ve wanted. 
        And right as he was about to lose his last sliver of hope, that’s when She arrived. The Archfey that took the form of a tall woman with the face and body of a humanoid moth covered in fluffy silk that glistened the color of the stars above. The Queen of the Stars Above and the Dreams Below revealed herself and with a simple wave of her hand, the hunters were gone, and he and his sister were safe.
        ***
        The very forest that changed his life. That saved his life. And he’d always be grateful for that. However, living anywhere for more than a decade would have its toll on him. Not even the Feywild. At first, he was enamored by the experience. Meeting an all-powerful being, witnessing the glory of the fabled Feywild he’d only heard of in fairytales, and seeing magic for the first time was something Ren held dear in his memories. 
        The experience was immediately dampened after learning how strict and confusing Lady Aurora was, but he was glad to see his sister get along with her. Though he had to admit how it did leave a sour taste in his heart, knowing she’d never know her real parents. That was one of the problems wasn’t it? The Queen of Stars did save their lives and gave them a home with everything they could possibly need with little worries for anything else, but nothing in this world would ever replace his parents. The parents he had known for the first seven years of his life that he loved so dearly. 
        Lady Aurora’s songs and stories could never replace his mother’s kind tales, nor his father’s wit. But to Faye, those would be it. He knew Faye would see Lady Aurora as her mother, but he never could. He respected the Archfey, but he could never see her as anyone other than a savior by chance. And maybe those feelings turned to bitterness over the years. 
        Regardless, he was here now and ready to face the music. He’d spent the past couple of weeks venturing around his childhood home in hopes of finding the same forest. Although a part of it was because he wanted to see what had become his old house, which to no one’s surprise was just a burnt ruin with the rest of the village. He was glad to see at least some foliage and overgrowth as the land was recovering, but it was clear no one was going to live here again. 
        He retraced his steps through the forest on the other side of town, trying to see if he could spot a Feywild crossing. And with some luck and special Fey senses, he did in fact actually find a crossing. With a little dance and some fairy dust, he crossed the planes and started calling out to the Archfey, hoping to get her attention in some way. 
        He never really learned how to contact Lady Aurora, but he figured she’d likely be watching him in some way. So, he just needed to let her know that he wanted to talk. He wasn’t sure if that would work, but if it didn’t then likely nothing would. She’d talk to him if she wanted to.
        Surprisingly, it seemed like she did as the forest in front of him turned back into that familiar eternal night with the stars shining brightly above. He never really got over how jarring it looked as he stepped from one side of the forest in an autumn day time to the night. Literally, he was seeing both day and night with a straight line cutting between them. 
        Taking a deep breath, Ren straightened his coat and lifted up his head as he stepped into the Sleeping Forest. His eyes took a moment to adjust to the sudden darkness as he walked through the path marked by the glowing foliage. Even having lived here for a good while he never could fully stop staring in awe all around him. 
        He’d been walking for a good few minutes, though, and the path eventually got way too repetitive for his liking. Shouldn’t she have met him by now? Or maybe she was just being petty and keeping him waiting. He couldn’t really complain, he supposed. He’d have done the same to anyone he was annoyed with. 
        Getting a bit too annoyed, however, Ren took a stand and shouted out, “Hey! Look, I get you’re probably really mad at me, but since you let me in you may as well hear me out! I’m not just gonna keep walking in circles for you–”
        Right at the end, he felt a swirl of wind hit him in the side and twist him around as the whole forest changed around him. The narrow path of trees around him transformed into a clearing bordered by tight rows of trees, and standing before him he realized was Lady Aurora in her majestic moth form radiating with the same mystical energy that always overwhelmed him. 
        Suddenly, he started to feel his eyes and body droop as exhaustion hit him. Usually this would bring serenity and comfort, but he recognized it for what it was and immediately shook the sleepiness off. For a moment, he was at a loss for words as he stared back into the starry eyes of the Archfey, who was practically staring into his soul. “I…” Ren started before he got a hold of himself and through his pride he gave a bow. “Lady Aurora, I’m…it’s good to see you again.”
        “Why are you here?” Her voice echoed with a cold steel.
        “I guess you could say I’m here to make amends.”
        Ever so slightly, he thought he saw the Archfey’s usual blank expression shift. “Now isn’t a good time.” With that she turned around with a wave of her silken wings as she started to walk away. 
        Ren watched her in surprise and quickly poofed in front of her as he misty stepped. “Look, please. I know we’re not on great terms in the slightest, but I really do want to do some repairing. It’s been ten years, surely we can start over?”
        “Start over? Now how do you intend to do that? Because I recall you wishing to escape from this so-called prison and now that you finally have, you want to come back?”
        “I’m not saying I want to come back—”
        “Then what are you here for? Because I made it very clear the terms of your banishment.”
        Ren froze. His lips tightened as he started to glare back into her eyes. That same condescending voice reminded him of why he had been partially relieved back then to be banished. And clear as day, the memories of their last moments together ten years ago manifested around them. 
        The Fool
        Ten years ago, Ren’s restlessness caused him to make another attempt to get out of the forest and find adventure outside in the wilderness. And his little sister, Faye, was with him all the way, despite her misgivings about the plan. She didn’t want to upset Mother after all, but Ren yearned to escape the Sleeping Forest that had grown too monotonous over the years and he had given Faye the option to not follow him if she was too afraid. But she remembered the promise they made together years ago, that they would always stick together. Ren remembered too.
        Through some luck, or rather bad luck, Ren and Faye did find an opening to enter the grand outside world. What they found was a glorious sight of the Feywild filled with bright lights from the sun and a brighter greenery compared to the dark violet colors of their home, but the beauty also brought about a sinister presence. 
        Their adventure had led them to stray further away from the Sleeping Forest than they had originally intended, spurred on by Ren’s excitement. And despite Faye’s urgence to turn back, Ren’s foolishness led to recklessness and very soon the consequences were found. They found many strange creatures that enamored Ren’s curiosity, but then came the moment they were attacked by one of these creatures. A battle that Ren tried to bravely take on, but with little experience he failed to protect his sister from getting hurt. 
        Luckily, Lady Aurora appeared before them to fend off the monsters and without a word brought the siblings back into the forest. Faye’s injuries were tended to while Ren was left to lick his own for a while, and after a long quiet and agonizing amount of time passed with him being left to think about what had happened and then what will happen the Archfey approached him. 
        “You were reckless. Naive. Foolish. Lucky. At. Best.”
        “I–I’m sorry, I just wanted to see—”
        “I warned you, Renedere. The world outside is far more dangerous than you could ever imagine. You should know that.”
        “I—”
        “And to endanger your sister too? Honestly, what were you thinking? I remember clearly the night you came running into my forest begging to live and for me to save your sister, and now that you’re alive you have a death wish?”
        “Well, maybe I’m tired of being stuck here for SEVEN years!” Ren cried out, tears welling up in his eyes but he violently wiped them away. “I didn’t want Faye to get hurt, but I can’t keep sitting around doing nothing while you pester me, trap me, and condescend me every single day! Maybe things wouldn’t have gone so badly if you just taught us how to handle the world instead of telling us how bad it is!”
        “I was warning you, so that these issues would never arise in the first place.”
        “Yeah, but now instead you just keep us here while we rot away!”
        “Are you really so ungrateful as to see this as a prison? I give you shelter and food, far beyond anything I’m obligated to do. If you’d have preferred I could have simply just left your corpse to rot all those years ago.”
        Ren tensed at that, feeling the sting of her words and guilt welling up his stomach. “No, no, I’m not ungrateful for that. But I just don’t get why you’re stopping us from just living too? You always talk to me in weird cryptic riddles and things that just never answer my questions! It’s frustrating and I feel like if I stay here any longer I’m going to go insane! How are we supposed to learn anything worthwhile if we can’t ever experience the real world?”
        The Archfey sighed. “Because you’re not ready. The fact that you can't solve the simple challenges I give you shows just how much your mind isn’t ready to navigate the deceptive reality that lives beyond this forest. The fact that you’ve already seen how dangerous the outside world is after you just went out there and faced dangers that you weren’t ready for and still won’t heed my warnings is a testament to how you aren’t wise enough to venture out and survive. Even Faye knows that.”
        “Well, you haven’t exactly done a good job of training us for that. I’m already eighteen! If I’m not ready to adventure out then when will I be? And what about Faye? What are you going to do when she becomes an adult? Just keep her here forever?”
        “Silence.”
        Ren did hesitate for a moment, but his anger was boiling over at this point and he didn’t care if he crossed a line. He had to deal with this bullshit for seven years now, and he couldn’t handle it anymore. “Or maybe staying cooped up is all you know. How long have you been trapped in your own forest with no one else around, huh? Until we finally came in and now you don’t want us to leave you all alone again.”
        The Archfey glared at him for several long moments as time around them seemed to freeze and Ren could feel the usual warm feeling of her aura turn ice cold. Her gaze remained locked on him until eventually she closed her eyes and seemed to give one final heaving sigh. “You wish to leave so badly? Very well.” She gave a swish of her wing and the dark forest around them parted to reveal a path directly to a sunny light leading outside of the domain. “Leave. See the world that you so desire to experience. But know this. The moment you step outside of this forest, you are forbidden from ever stepping foot back.”
        “What? But–”
        “This is what you wished for, yes? You’ll go insane the longer you stay here, well luckily for you, you’ll never have to come back.”
        “What about my sister? What about Faye?”
        “So, now you care about her? She will be safe. Safer, likely, now that you won’t be around to pull her into danger.”
        Ren’s eyes started to well up with tears as he glanced between the open path and Lady Aurora. Did he really want this? He couldn’t say he didn’t ask for this, but at the same time he’d be abandoning basically everything left that he knew. 
        “The choice is ultimately yours to make. Just as you wanted. Feel free to bid farewell to your sister.” Lady Aurora started to walk away, never looking back at Ren as she blended with the winds back into the forest. 
        “Wait! Hang on!”
        “Enjoy your adventures, Renedere. Goodbye.” 
        The Brother
        But since then he’s been through so much, and he learned a lot in those ten years. From becoming a circus performer and an actor at a carnival, to being hunted down by a powerful noble, to forming a bond with a colorful cast of friends and going on the types of dramatic adventures he always dreamed about, and finally becoming something of renown. 
        By now, he’d dealt with creatures far worse than the Queen of Stars. And to be honest, she was probably the tamest super powerful being he’s had to face before. With all that, he had to let go of whatever animosity he held between them if he wanted to correct the first mistake he ever made. Besides, from what he gathered, it’d be a lot more beneficial if he was more polite. Lady Aurora was the type to prefer the formal mask that he’d wear.
        “I wanted to say I’m sorry. For everything. Back then, I really was such a fool, being all reckless and ungrateful.” He sighed. “I learned that there is some merit to your methods. I didn’t really understand it back then with all your riddles and puzzles, but I guess in a way they did help me think creatively and see multiple meanings behind certain things. Honestly, I guess I can thank you for helping me get out of more scraps than I can count even after my banishment. And I’m not just talking about you giving me some magic.” 
        At the corner of his eye, he saw her expression shift again ever so slightly, but no ideas of what she could be thinking ever escaped her gaze. He continued, “The other thing is Faye. I know my sister has been under your care for all her life and she’s turned out amazing, which of course I already knew that’d be the case, but…I guess I’m willing to admit now that your methods were especially effective for her. She’s learned a lot about magic, being a good person, and whatnot. And despite how I’ve felt or acted, I guess you’re the main reason for that.”
        “So, you did go to see your sister.”
        “I did. Thanks for letting me know, by the way. Even though you could’ve just sent me to her yourself.”
        “The only reason why I sent you that message was out of courtesy.”
        “Right, well, seeing her then really made me realize how much I missed just spending time with her. And I’d like to see her more often without needing to cross worlds.”
        “Our arrangement was clear, Renedere. You may never return to the forest so long as the yearn for adventure clings to your heart.”
        “I don’t see how that’s fair now? You say that and yet you’re willing to send Faye out into a completely different world?”
        “The difference is that she and I have a different arrangement. I’ve taught her well enough to deal with most of the outside world and it would hardly be beneficial for her to stay in the forest when she’s already learned so much. Having her study at the most prestigious magical university known in the multiverse was the best option for her safety and growth.”
        Ren scoffed, “Is that so? Then, what about the monster attacks? I’m sure she’s told you all about them.”
        “She has, and she is still safe.”
        “What?”
        “A year’s worth of attacks have gone by and yet she still lives.”
        “And what if she didn’t live? What then? Look, I’m happy she’s going to school and actually seeing some of the world, but how does that make any sense? Hell, what about me? I’ve been out in the world and I’m perfectly fine.”
        “I had every bit of confidence to know that Faye would be fine.” The Archfey sighed. “And I am glad to see that your dream of adventure was successful. However, the issue is that you have and will continue to defy my wishes and my lessons. I cannot allow chaos to run amok in my domain.”
        “What, so just because I don’t follow your rules I can’t see my sister? She’s a grown woman now. What if she wants to talk or see me but she can’t because of your stupid persistence to keep up my banishment?” He misspoke. He knew it as soon as the words left his mouth, but part of him didn’t care as his emotions boiled up. Was he in the wrong here? Maybe, but this was ridiculous. He wasn’t just being selfish at this point, even though he was, but it was for Faye’s sake too. 
        The Archfey merely sighed again. “As I’ve stated before on the terms of your exile. If you relinquish your desires to adventure beyond the Sleeping Forest, then I shall lift your banishment. The fact that I’m even giving you this option after everything is more than enough courtesy.”
        Ren looked down, swallowing a stinging feeling in the back of his throat. Well, he guessed he couldn’t really say Lady didn’t give him some option. But to him, there hardly was a choice. He loved Faye, and wanted to spend more time with his sister, that was certain. But he also loved everything that he’d experienced outside. The friends he made. The wonders he’s seen and the mystery of many more he had yet to see. For once, he finally understood who he was and what he wanted. To give all that up would just be an insult to all the years of challenges he faced just to get here. There had to be another way, and Lady Aurora knew it too. He had to make her see.
        “No. I can’t. You know I can’t. In the few years that I spent after leaving this home, I found treasures that I can never give up. I almost died, sure, many times in fact, but I made friends that saved me. I’ve seen extraordinary sights of beautiful sunrises over glistening mountains that this forest could never have shown. Did you know that the city of Clockstone could look so glorious at night with their magic lights and everything? Don’t get me wrong, this forest is great and beautiful in its own right, but there’s a reason why I wanted to leave. You always said how dangerous and dark the world could be, but you can’t ignore just how magnificent it can also be.”
        Ren kept going, not letting Lady Aurora to respond until he was fully done. “I’ve learned a lot about being more caring towards others and less of a selfish prick, which I know I’m ashamed that I had to learn that in the first place, but hey, I never claimed to be perfect. Still though, I guess all that isn’t good enough for you anyways. And that’s fine, honestly, but what about Faye? You sent her off to school now, but don’t you realize that being around all those other people would mean she could be influenced by them? She’s going to outgrow this forest eventually and you know that with how much stronger she’s getting. And she’s getting smarter and bolder too. I’ve seen it, believe me. Even if it doesn’t seem like it so far, you know it’s a matter of time before she gets as restless as I am. We’re siblings after all.”
        For once, Lady Aurora showed more emotions to Ren outside of coldness or anger. Visible exhaustion, and a hint of sadness? The Archfey sighed. “Yes, I am aware. And I am fully prepared for Faye’s eventual decision to leave.”
        Ren’s face scrunched up in confusion, “Wait, what?”
        “You are right that Faye will outgrow this forest. It is natural for any animal to outgrow their homes and leave their caretakers. As her guardian, I’ve done my best to prepare her for the future. You leaving did show me that that time will come very soon.”
        “Did you just admit that I’m right?”
        “I expect that once Faye graduates from Strixhaven, she’ll leave this forest for her own adventure. A new chapter of her life into adulthood as a fully fledged druid of the stars. With the knowledge of different worlds, magics, and the relationships she’s made, I have no doubt that she’ll have a fruitful journey. One that will likely surpass even yours. And one without my presence.”
        Ren choked out a dry laugh, “You’re saying that Faye will leave the forest? And what? Are you not going to stay in her life?”
        “I’ve already seen it in the stars. At this point, my self-imposed duty as your guardian is finished. And very soon, I shall return to my old life in solitude.”
        “But, surely you’d expect Faye would want to visit you again? I mean, yeah, she’ll need to go off and make her own life, but you’re still her mom. She’s going to want to see you again, or at least have some sort of contact?”
        “I hardly see the benefit in holding an attachment to the past. Or to return to it. She’ll have no need to return here and I’ll have no need to see her again. That said, I won’t force her to leave if she doesn’t wish to. It’ll only just be a waste of her potential.”
        “What? What kind of logic is that? If she leaves then she should still have the option to come back or see you again. That doesn’t mean holding onto the past, it just means wanting to see someone you love. It means coming back to visit a parent because you care about them. You’re her mom, Aurora, and you’ll break her heart if you just abandon her.”
        “Faye is smart enough to understand the necessity of this for her growth. And regardless of what you or Faye have fooled yourselves into thinking, I’m hardly a being that can be called a mother. I only sheltered, fed, and educated you both because I felt compelled to save a pair of young injured animals that didn’t get the chance to live.”
        “And you wouldn’t have done that if you didn’t love us too. Or at the very least Faye, I know you care about her. No one goes through all these lengths for nothing. Is this really what you want? For her to leave and you’re never able to see her again?”
        Lady Aurora sighed once more, looking back at Ren with eyes that definitely held a sign of sadness in them. But her voice was firm and cold. “I do care about Faye. But she is no more than the equivalent of a pet to me in relation to your mortal life. I have lived since the rise of the second cycle, where time first started to tick, and the first civilizations of life only just sprouted. I have witnessed the rise and fall of thousands of kingdoms, the birth and death of billions of stars, and the passing of many relationships. And I shall continue to exist for several thousand millennia until the inevitable end of the universe. You nor Faye could ever imagine such an existence. Even if Faye mastered the druidic arts and unlocked the secrets to a longer lifespan, she would still only get to live for a mere fraction of my existence. No matter how much I allow myself to care about you two, our time together will only ever be a blip in my memory. So, yes, I do care about Faye and even you. But I am wise enough to understand that I cannot grow attached. You will leave. Faye will leave. I will return to my solitude. You both will remember me as a being that saved your life once when you were young and raised you for a few years. And you will be nothing more than a footnote in my history.”
        “And you’re seriously fine with that?” Ren hardly believed what he was hearing, but he’d be lying if part of him hadn’t expected that this would be the case. At some point, they’d all have to face the reality that Lady Aurora was an Archfey. An ancient and powerful being that experienced a life far different from them. Honestly, the fact that such a being had taken it upon themselves to take care of them both was an anomaly. Most Archfey likely would’ve just done it out of some sort of self-interest or form of entertainment, but the Queen of Stars put up with way more than anyone else would have. Regardless, she was never their mother. 
        Lady Aurora’s silence was all the answer he’d receive on that part. And he could do little more. All the fight pretty much left him as his face turned crestfallen. He thought about the past, the time he and Faye spent in the forest, and how Faye spent even more than he did here. He wondered how she’d feel. Did she fully realize what her relationship with Lady Aurora meant? What future awaited her in only one or two more years? In the end, it didn’t really matter as much to him. Even if his banishment is never lifted, Ren would just have to wait until Faye leaves the forest. He already missed out on ten years, what’s a couple more? Still, it left a bitter taste in his mouth. “Fine. Have it your way—”.
        A loud shriek cut through the air as the leaves in the forest rustled violently. 
        Both of them turned to look toward the direction of the sound and Ren turned to look at Lady Aurora. “What in the world was that?”
        The Archfey made an annoyed click sound, “I told you this wasn’t a good time. Our conversation is over, you should leave now.”
        “What? Wait a minute, is there something in your forest right now? What’s going on?”
        “Just some pests I need to deal with, it’s none of your concern.”
        “My sister lives in this forest. If there’s something dangerous in here that you’re having trouble dealing with, then it very much is my business.”
        “I’m not having trouble.”
        “If you’re not, then why the hells is there even an issue right now? Don’t you have a barrier around this place that stops anything from anything you don’t want from getting in? How did you let something dangerous get in here?” He paused for a moment as he thought a little more, “Wait a minute…did you even let me in here?”
        The Archfey remained silent as Ren’s eyes widened in confusion, “Lady Aurora, seriously, what’s going on?”
        She sighed and turned to stare at him with her familiarly cold boundless eyes, “For your own safety, Renedere. Leave.”
        But the adventurer stood his ground. “I’m not worried about my safety. You’re saying that you’ll deal with it, huh? Despite you failing to protect your forest as usual? Exactly how long have you been dealing with this issue?”
        Lady Aurora’s silence was all the confirmation Ren needed, especially now that he also remembered what Faye said about trouble going on back at the forest. He had assumed Lady Aurora would’ve dealt with it already and everything seemed fine, but now that he knew that it likely was weeks to months now that this was going on, clearly the Archfey needed help.
        “Look, I have friends I can call over to help. Great people, I promise you. We saved the world after all.”
        “No. You being here is one thing. I absolutely will not allow for any more strangers to enter my domain.”
        “Fine, then I guess you can just settle for me.”
        “No.”
        “Tsk, tsk, Aurora. Why are you so against everything I suggest? I’m literally offering you my help since clearly this issue is going on way longer than it should, and you know I’m fully capable.”
        “You understand that this problem goes far beyond anything you’ve faced with whatever adventures you’ve gone on.”
        “Hey! I fought a demon dragon that was going to eat the world, I think I’ll be fine. Plus, if it's that tough, then surely my help won’t hurt right? We can get this done in no time, just give me the sitch.” Ren snapped his fingers and offered his signature adventurer's smile as he put on the mask of Casanova the great adventurer. He fully knew that Lady Aurora wouldn’t be too charmed by it, but this was the face he made when he was serious about solving a problem fit for an adventurer. “And even if you don’t tell me, I can definitely figure it out myself now that I know you can’t kick me out.”
        He did get what he wanted though, which was a noticeable reaction as the Archfey’s star-filled eyes visibly swirled around in a rolling eyes motion. “Don’t get arrogant, child. I very much can get rid of you. But if you’re so insistent, then very well. There are several monsters roaming this forest now after several continuous breaches of the dimensional barrier. I’ve done my best to deal with them, but their numbers simply continue to increase. I’ve already deduced that something is causing the barrier to weaken, which is what gives the creatures the chance to enter. Something that is giving a constant magical signal from my domain to the central Feywild that is offering a direct path. Normally, the barrier or myself would be capable enough to simply cut off that signal. However, it seems that the magic is also negatively affecting my own magic.”
        “So, it’s affecting you directly? Geez, I didn’t think there was such a thing.”
        “Such magical artifacts that can attack all-powerful beings do exist quite frequently actually. However, usually it takes a great deal of magical expertise and is dedicated to specifically countering the type of magic that surrounds an eternal being.”
        “Artifact? So, there’s some item somewhere in here that’s weakening your barrier and you?”
        “Yes.”
        “How in the world did it even get in here in the first place?”
        Lady Aurora was silent for a moment before saying in a grave voice, “I’m not sure. But I do have an idea as to who’s responsible.”
        Ren raised an eyebrow, but got the feeling she wouldn’t explain any further. “Alright, so mission is to find whatever this item is, get rid of it, and problem solved?”
        “That’s…yes, that should be enough. However, this item has remained hidden away from even my own senses. I’ve scoured my entire domain.”
        “Hmm, maybe I’ll have some more luck. I mean it is targeted specifically at you, right? I doubt it’ll be prepared for the great Casanova Dares!”
        “How do you intend to traverse my forest? You’ll be unlikely to get anywhere without me leading you and at that point it would be the same.”
        “Then give me free reign to roam around.”
        “Absolutely not.”
        “Oh c’mon. Look this is more for your sake than mine, plus at the end of the day you’re still stronger than me. Believe me, I won’t mess anything up than it’s already been, okay? I promise.” He offered the Archfey a handshake and winked.
        Lady Aurora simply stared at him, as dumbfounded as an Archfey could possibly be. Pensively, she did accept his handshake with one of her long silky moth arms and then opened up the forest around them. The trees that had bordered their little clearing were pushed back to reveal several possible paths that led deeper into the forest. Ren smiled, knowing that he was finally getting somewhere. 
        “Awesome. Don’t worry, oh Queen of the Stars! I’ll find that pesky artifact in no time,” Ren said with a bow before skipping towards one of the paths, but he slowed when Lady Aurora called out to him. 
        “Renedere. This act that you’re putting up. You realize it won’t help against truly dangerous foes. The monsters that are here are capable of tearing any mortal creature apart.”
        “Oh, I’m sure.”
        “And yet, you still wish to help? Why? Faye isn’t here. Your sister is in no danger here. And I…you have no reason to help me.”
        Ren kept smiling, looking back at the Archfey. For once in all the times he faced the Queen of the Stars and Dreams, Ren finally felt like he knew something she didn’t understand. “Sure, I do.” With all things considered, he never regretted becoming an adventurer. “Cause that’s what heroes do.”
        ***
        Ren had spent the last hour wandering aimlessly through the dark forest, or was it minutes? He never fully understood how time worked in the Feywild. From his experience in the Sleeping Forest it was in its own bubble of time that ran normally like in the Material Plane, or maybe it was all just another illusion. 
        Regardless, Ren figured he was lost and wandering in circles. All the trees, dirt paths, and foliage looked the same and were even harder to distinguish when he had to deal with all the darkness. The glowing patterns just weren’t enough when he needed to find something specific, and on that matter he didn’t even know what it looked like. 
        Groaning, Ren sat down on a rock and looked up to the stars that strangely enough looked the exact same from when he last remembered seeing them. Some things just never changed. He looked down on the ground and into a nearby puddle of some built of evening dew. His face reflected back at him. But he’s changed, right? He shapeshifted his face into the different personas that he’s created throughout his adventures, always switching and adopting, like new fashion phases where he wore different masks. These adventures he’s had were more than just his adventures. They were stories where he lived many lives. And each one formed to make up his own.
        The Dreamer
        “Can you please sit still already and let me help you?” Thestalos snapped at Casanova (Ren) with a bit of fire sizzling from his draconic snout as the Paladin proceeded to hold his arm down and heal the large gash running down his shoulder to his bicep. 
        Casanova winced, but plastered a smile back on his face. “Alright, alright, don’t need to get all snappy. Honestly, I never knew you’d be so worried about me. It really isn’t a big deal.”
        The gold dragonborn grumbled, “If we’re going to make it out of this damned mountain, then we’re going to need everyone at their best. And not on the verge of losing an arm.”
        The rest of the party were closeby, either sitting or standing on the cold stone floor of a little cave they found for shelter, and they were also tending to their own injuries. Clocksten, their warforged sorcerer, was fixing up a loose screw in his staff. Amyra, their tiefling wizard, was working on a few spells and healing her wounds with potions. After the last battle against those Ropers, they could all use a breather. 
        “Honestly, Cas, did you really have to run up that thing?” Amyra broke the moment of silence. 
        Casanova shrugged, “Those things were being really pesky. You and Doc were busy holding our flanks and Thestalos couldn’t get any openings when the big one kept attacking his shield. So, I figured we could speed things along if I just created an opening.”
        “Surely you could’ve calculated a more optimal way?” Clocksten had gotten up from his position and walked over to the two. 
        He shrugged again, “I didn’t exactly have a lot of room for any of my spells. Plus, I’ve never really been good at precision anyways, so the best thing was to do the other thing that I'm good at. Being one hell of a distraction.”
        “Well you were still incredibly stupid,” Thestalos grunted, finishing the healing finally and giving him a rough smack as he got up. “You’re lucky it only nicked you. Any more and you wouldn’t have an arm anymore. And even then, you’re lucky that it only hit your arm and didn’t get anything more vital.”
        “Yeah, yeah, I know, I know…”
        “Do you know? Each fight we’ve been in you’ve always been so reckless. Jumping in and not staying in formation, getting up close to monsters when you know full well how squishy you are, do you have a death wish or something?”
        “What’s the point of living if I’m just going to stay back and watch other people have all the fun? I’m here for a good time, not a long time.”
        “And there you go again with your quips. You can have your fun and your life, you know that right? Don’t you have anything else to live for? Didn’t you say you had a sister or something?”
        “I’m sure she’s better off without me anyways,” He had meant to say it more lightheartedly, but even he couldn’t prevent the bitter sadness from passing through and from everyone else’s point of view it was rare for him to ever say anything so seriously before. 
        The room went silent for a good few seconds as everyone took a moment to glance over at the changeling. Thestalos sighed, rubbing his eyes. “Look, Cas. I remember very vividly how much you love to rave about your sister, and I don’t know exactly what happened between you two, but all I can say is, coming from experience, you shouldn’t discount your relationships. Especially with the people you care about.”
        He gave a dry laugh, “Yeah, I know. It’s just…there’s a lot between us right now. I mean, I’m banished from my home, running away from a powerful fey noble who wants me dead, and here I am stuck in a cave running errands for the kingdom. This adventure type thing hasn’t exactly worked out the way I thought it would. So, you know, I’m just happy knowing my sister’s better off with or without me.”
        Amyra flicked him on the forehead. “Ow! What was that for?”
        “Is that really something the oh, so magnificent Casanova Dares would say? Please, being pragmatic is Thestalos’s job. Things may not be looking good now, but that doesn’t mean things won’t get better. As far as I’ve seen we’ve been through worse. Like that time we fought those cultists the day we met, and we ended up in another tight space. And yet, despite how bad that looked, here we are still alive and those cultists not. So, Mr. Adventurer Extraordinaire, you’ve made it this far. We all have. And right now we’re all together, which is all we really need to complete our mission.”
        Thestalos even cracked a smile at that, “What she said.”
        Cas continued rubbing his forehead and nodded, but Clocksten also spoke up. “It’s important for us not to lose hope. Despite all the downs on our journey, we shouldn’t lose sight of all the ups. I’m sure your sister misses you as much as you miss her, Casanova. So, I’m positive that she’ll enjoy hearing about your escapades when you see her again. But that can never happen if you give up when you’ve come so far.”
        He sniffed, masking his face with a smile. “Sure…thanks guys.”
        The night passed as the party finally took their rest for the long day ahead, but as they awoke their eccentric changeling bard was nowhere to be seen. However, they all heard Casanova’s voice cry out to them, leading them up a path in the cave. 
        Sunlight pierced through some rocks that had crumbled down from the wall and Casanova led them to an exit out of the mountain. After days of traveling in the dark caverns, it came as a relief to finally be free. 
        Casanova had felt the same draw of something greater waiting for him when he was asleep in the cave. The same call of the wild that led him to want to adventure in the first place. And both times he heeded that call. Following the sense, he snuck out of the little nook they took refuge in and took the risk to explore the path ahead. 
        That call turned out to lead him toward the path that led outside the cave, and when the first signs of light and the cool morning breeze came through he took off. In full excitement, he quickly pushed past the rocks and debris to escape the monotonous caves and breathed in a large breath of the fresh air. 
        The mountain revealed to him in a bright flash of warm sunlight as he stared out in awe of the sight before him. The other mountains in the region with their luscious green foliage and majestic stone structures reflected off the morning light as the sun rose with a vibrant orange glow. This was it. The amazing sights that he always dreamed of. The very reason why he wanted to adventure. 
        They were all right. Despite all the troubles he had to get through. Despite all the sadness, despair, anger, and fear. All that led up to these brief moments where he could stare in awe at the beauty of the world. Even better when he had companions to enjoy the adventure with him. The thrill of the heights and winds that followed. All of this made it all worth it. His dream come true.
        When his party had finally joined him out of the mountain, the bard twirled around to look at them with newfound energy. “Alright, gang! Let’s get this show back on the road!”
        The Monster
        Ren smiled at the memory as he broke away from staring at the puddle and heaved himself up from his resting rock. He clapped his hands on both sides of his cheeks to regain his energy and laughed. “That’s right, no time to wallow now. We’ve got a job to do.” 
        But then he frowned, because the “we” in this case was just him. Man, nothing like a flashback to make you miss your friends. He started walking through the forest, looking around to see if he could spot any different features that could maybe lead him to more progress. 
        Another thought crossed his mind. What about all those monsters Lady Aurora said were in here. He hadn’t seen any so far and the only signs he heard were just their roars in the distance. He wondered what they were like to give the Archfey so much trouble. Then again, it seemed less the monsters themselves and more their constant increasing numbers. That was the whole reason why he needed to find the artifact after all. But it did make him feel a little on edge given how usually whenever something that should be around isn’t around for a while means that something’s wrong. Especially when it comes to nasty monsters, then they would probably be coming around right…
        The goosebumps were the first warning as a blood curdling roar erupted from the forest behind him and a large creature zipped out to strike at him. Ren managed to turn around in time to see the monster’s long bladed arm coming towards him as it sliced right through his neck and down his torso. 
        Thankfully, Ren was standing a couple feet away from the attack or else that could’ve killed him. The “Ren” that the monster had slashed revealed to be an illusion as its torn figure disappeared back into thin air. And clearly, the monster had noticed as it raised their head up in what seemed to be confusion and sniffed the air. 
        While invisible, Ren managed to get an opportunity to get a better look at it while the monster didn’t see him. Thick leather hide, nasty looking scimitar-like claws, multiple limbs, a barbed tail, and a really ugly face. He took note of the missing eyes too, which to his dread likely meant it didn’t rely on sight. That got confirmed as the monster finished sniffing the air and certainly caught wind of where he was. 
        Ren had to jump out of the way of another attack and was forced out of invisibility as he tried casting a charm on the creature, and then a sleep spell. But both of them didn’t work and the monster was really charging at him. He was lucky he had a cloak of displacement to just narrowly dodge some attacks, and at some point he had to resort to straight up teleporting away to put distance between them. 
        If none of his non-violent ways were going to work, then he guessed he just had no choice. Ren bounced back to avoid another attack from the creature, practically flying through the air as the monster gave chase. It was a miracle that anyone could keep their cool in such a panicked situation, but the seasoned adventurer had the creature right where he wanted.
        The two were in midair as he raised his hand, pointing his index finger to aim directly at the monster and grinned. “Bang!” A bolt of chaotic energy shot out of his finger like a revolver as it blasted off the monster’s right arm.
        “Bang!” Another burned through its left leg.
        “Bang!” The final third beam of eldritch blast struck the monster’s head and blew it clean out as Ren landed on his back foot to clear the smoke from his finger and took a stage bow as the monster’s corpse landed on the ground. 
        Taking a deep breath, he went over to try and examine the creature a bit more, though he may have shown off a bit too much given how there wasn’t much left that he could investigate. He was never really the knowledgeable one in his party, so he couldn’t exactly get much from this. However, he wouldn’t have time to anyways when he sensed more scuffling. Two more monsters materialized from the tree lines and charged at him.
        Sighing, Ren went right back to his routine. He fired several more eldritch blasts that bolted through the air to hit the creatures, but this time they weren’t enough to take them out. When they got close again, Ren poofed into several clones of himself to try and disorientate them, but somehow he completely forgot about the whole not relying on sight thing. 
        Quickly finding the real Ren, the monsters got a quick slash that did nick him on the shoulder and he barely managed to block the next attack as it sent him flying through the woods. Catching himself on a tree, Ren looked up just in time to see one of the monsters launching itself at him with another attack and he misty stepped out of the way. The monster cut right into the tree, but its blade got lodged right in, keeping it stuck for a few seconds. Seconds that Ren needed. 
        Alright, so you don’t need to see? That’s fine. Because luckily for me, not all illusions need to be sight-based. Ren snapped his fingers and another illusion of himself appeared right next to the monster. The illusion then soon erupted in a cacophony of laughter, making sure to catch the monsters’ attention and Ren sent the illusion running away. The monster ripped itself out of the tree and gave chase with their friend following close behind. Ren could finally catch his breath.
        The Moth
        The Queen of the Stars stood in one place. Unmoving. Staring up at the sky as the stars glimmered against the reflections in her fathomless eyes. The very constellations that formed twisted and turned as they formed scene after scene of memories upon the endless abyss.
        A woman stared back at her with a radiant smile and the familiar scent of dreams that wafted over her. She dances in the twilight with laughter and smiles. A mortal from summer days that the Archfey had foolishly grown attached with in her winter nights. And even worse, she promised a paradise only dreams could offer. A paradise where their dreams could come true. But nothing ever comes without a price.
        A desire to gain the power great enough to alter the very fabric of reality into a paradise that the Queen envisioned for her princess traveled across disastrous events. The desire overtaking any amount of rationality the longer it festered. 
        The foolishness to work with a mad mage’s schemes and offer power that should never have crossed beyond the realm of dreams. The plague that absorbed all the primal energy that sustained the natural world all to be siphoned into one magnificent claim of power. 
        Her only friend was the only one to see the madness and put an end to the plague. But to do so required the absorption of power that would consume any mind. The poor girl’s hopes and dreams turned to star dust in the grasp of her arms. The Queen’s grief was silent as her tears flowed through two domains that held no paradise. Shame, guilt, anger, or sorrow, none of those feelings could be felt, but neither could joy or love be as well. The Queen hid away as she vowed to herself that the darkness of the night would be the only thing that she would ever know until the end of time.
        Lady Aurora’s gaze broke away from the memories as she sighed to herself. Even now her past actions still haunted her. And even with the wisdom of an eon, she still failed to learn. Not even Archfey were immune to their own follies. This was for the best. Her choices have always been for the best. They’d understand eventually.
        But things have changed. Her past was bound to catch up with her eventually and she wouldn’t allow others to suffer for her own actions. That was the whole point of her seclusion after all, but even then she didn’t follow her own orders.
        She had to save them. They were injured lost animals that would’ve never had the chance to live if it weren’t for her. But the cycle of life is naturally cruel. She should’ve never interfered. But she was nature. Her very actions define an aspect of the natural world, but that’s exactly why she needed to be careful. An arch-beings power was so great that their very presence can influence the environment around them in extreme ways, forcing drastic change wherever they go. Even ecosystems can grow to be dependent on their existence if enough time has passed. 
        Aurora had seen first hand how her interference in the natural order could bring about disasters. The brief visions of the futures that she constantly viewed as she stared at the stars always held some sort of dire consequence whenever she took action. Of course, those disasters hardly mattered in the grand scheme of the world. Forests would burn, mountains would crumble, and species may die out. But overtime the world would recover and new life would grow in its place. After all, her actions were as natural as the world itself. 
        But then, why was she so hesitant to take action? Because there is still a threat to causing such a rift in the balance of the world, there was still the chance to actually cause lasting consequences. No matter how small. The Colorless Plague is one example. The Feywild barely recovered from that disaster and after the plague had disappeared, so did an Archfey. She knew her equals would inquire about her whereabouts, but they’d hardly care enough to do much to actually seek her out. Not even the other Archfeys would be able to find her anyways with how she hid her domain, but then that begged the question of how her forest was still being invaded. 
        She had taken every precaution in the creation of her domain, so what changed? The children…Every action has a dire consequence. 
        Should she have done differently? Should she have simply left the young changelings to die? Why did she save them in the first place? 
        On that fateful night, Lady Aurora had been floating along the edges of her forest. Tracking the movements of the stars as her sky blended with the sky along the Material Plane. Her forest was conveniently close to a Feywild crossing, though she usually kept that specific area extra fortified with her barrier to prevent any accidental intruders. However, the sounds of a hurt animal’s cries still resonated in her mind to this day. 
        A boy and his even younger sister were chased by hunters. She could’ve easily ignored the cries and let nature take its course. But part of her reasoned that it wasn’t natural. Hunters were supposed to hunt out of need for survival, but she recognized that these ones had been hunting for sport. Two young souls that deserved to live out their lives shouldn’t have been allowed to be taken with such callous cruelty. It was unnatural.
        But who was she to decide that? The last time she made that sort of judgment of her own accord it cracked the Feywild. Against such a logic, she did aid them. Not only saving their lives, but also caring for them the same way a human mother would care for her children. How did she even know to act in such a way? Why did she even feel the need to go so far for them? Saving them was one thing, but caring for them? 
        Of course, she had too. Saving their lives would’ve been pointless if they weren’t nurtured properly. But she was no mother. A being like her barely even understood the concept of parental love. She never had a mother, no one ever had to care for her. She was born into immeasurable power, of course no one needed to nor even felt safe to. 
        And yet…seeing those small children huddled under her wing, taking shelter in her soft embrace, looking up at her with eyes that looked like tiny stars themselves, the Archfey always felt at a loss of what she felt in those moments. Was that love? Was that the emotion of care? How? How was it possible for such a feeling to exist? To a being that had no business feeling such a thing. These creatures were merely blips in her existence. They’d be children hugging her one second and then gone the next. As fleeting as a moth's lifespan. 
        Lady Aurora’s entire body shook as the forest around began to quake and the night sky above became cloudy. A trembling thunderstorm seemed like it was about to break out any second before immediately dispersing as quickly as it formed. The Archfey took a moment to recompose herself, clutching a hand to her head. “What has become of me?”
        Showtime
        Ren coughed as he slumped against the tree, blood coming out in splatters. The monster standing before him clicked its jaws in its usual guttural warning, readying its jaws for the kill. He slowly looked up to meet the creature’s eyeless gaze, taking note once again of its razor sharp blade arms, dagger-like tail raised up like a scorpion and dripping with acid. 
        His limited attacks did do some damage, but he was never built for offensive combat. The creature was relentless in its attacks. The first one seemed weak enough for him to deal with, but he wasn’t sure what to call it. More and more monsters just kept coming and coming, each one seemingly stronger than the last too. 
        He’d fought a lot of monsters even tougher than this one before, but they were far easier to deal with when he was with his party. He was alone now, resources depleting fast, and exhaustion starting to get to him. And yet, he couldn’t help but laugh.
        Even after saving the world from a demonic dragon, Ren’s life of adventure still wasn’t without perils. That’s what he signed up for after all. Regardless, this ugly, walking sack of rotten flesh wasn’t going to be the thing that put him down today. He’d just made up with his sister and already promised to see her again. He also made a challenge with Lady Aurora that he could handle saving her forest from these pests and he wasn’t about to lose. He was far too petty for that. 
        Finding his footing, Ren stood back up and smirked. The monster went down into a pouncing position as it readied to tear its claws into him.
        “You know, buddy. You should count yourself lucky. If I had my friends here you’d have been knocked into the sun by now, but I guess that’s fine either way. Cuz that just means I can pull out my best tricks.” He raised up a hand at the monster as magical particles started to swirl around him and his skin started to glow with faerie tattoos that illuminated the dark night in a vibrant bioluminescent hue. “So, feel honored. You’re about to find out why they call me the Trickster Prince.” 
        The creature charged at him with a vicious roar, but it was too late. With a snap of his fingers, the world around them flashed in a rainbow of every single color that conceptually existed along with sounds and odors of every kind to create a maelstrom of pure chaos. His silhouette transformed into a grinning specter as he harnessed the extravagantly magnificent and terrifying majesty known only to the Fey, deafening the monster in an overwhelming display of spectacular magic. 
        However, that wasn’t the end of it. That special move was mainly all an act. A powerful illusion meant to disorient and distract the monster from moving, trapping it in place to give Ren enough time to do his thing. For as this was all happening, the real Ren had walked all the way around the creature until he stood close behind it. Taking a silver blade engraved with runes that was blessed by a high priest on one adventure, Ren slid that dagger deep into the monster’s neck and cut clean through all connections. 
        Majesty of the Trickster Prince ended in one final dazzling act with the monster’s head falling clean to the floor and dissolving from the burning radiant effect by the dagger along with the rest of its body. Ren stood over with a grim expression, sheathing the dagger underneath his garments and started to walk away.
        Of course, the fight wasn’t over. After such an intensive use of energy, his guard was down as he failed to sense the next attack in time. A giant claw slashed across his back as another monster pounced on him. Through gritted teeth, he tried his best to hold himself together as the pain surged through. Ren looked back to see the creature’s jaws unhinge in a shriek. 
        Thinking quickly, he reached up to the necklace around his neck and tore it off. The six orange beads dangled with a flash of fire as Ren threw down another last ditch trick. A blast of fire erupted between him and the monster, sending both of them flying away from each other. 
        Ren crashed through the branches and brambles, using the moment to get away as far as he could away from the monster. He didn’t immediately get up as he tumbled onto the ground and rolled himself on the grass to ease his pain and the fire that burned his clothes. 
        “Oooouch…” After a good while he tried to get up, groaning. “God, that’s gonna leave a mark,” he said as he cast Healing Word to stitch up the gash on his back. 
        Looking around at where he landed, though, he got a wave of nostalgia as he recognized the old childhood clearing with the big central tree and the lake and hill and everything. The world around him practically spun around him as a flood of memories poured in and it wasn’t until now that he realized just how much he really missed this place. 
        The time for reminiscing was going to have to wait, though, as Ren turned to see the monster showing its ugly face again as it prowled out of the woods and entered the clearing. To make matters worse, the rest of the pack had arrived. Two, three, four…about ten more of those monsters seemed to materialize out of the trees surrounding him and sniffed their way in. 
        The Truth
        He thought that Aurora would’ve at the very least taken precautions to protect this clearing from any threats, but maybe that wasn’t how it worked. Or maybe, he led them here. That explosion did knock him in here, which may have created an opening. But that didn’t make total sense either. In fact, half of these monsters didn’t even seem to notice him. 
        He stood very still and used a bit of magic to mask his scent with the rest of the environment. Obviously, he could take on a couple of these monsters so long as he kept an eye on each one, but ten was way too much if they were coming at him all at once. He could definitely use his party to share the attention, or better yet a certain Archfey would really be helpful. 
        Whatever, he didn’t need to take all these guys on anyways. The artifact was hidden somewhere…Wait a minute. Why were there so many monsters here specifically? Again they didn’t seem to be looking for him. Maybe they were and he was just so hidden, but they were just sniffing all over the place. 
        They were definitely looking for something. And if it wasn’t him, then he had an idea of what the next thing would be. Slowly, he sneaked around to watch where they were going. However, no matter how much he followed where they looked it almost seemed like they were as lost as he was. He had hoped to find the artifact like this, and that it would just pop up somewhere, but nothing. Everything looked the same as it did before and Ren’s eyes started getting hazy with the growing unease. The monsters would notice him eventually and he didn’t like watching them sniff around all their stuff. 
        Ren grumbled as he examined his options, taking note of how exhausted he was and the few tricks he had left in him. These guys just wouldn’t give up. And there was still no sign of the artifact. Surely, the master of this forest had some trick up her sleeve? Or maybe she was just relishing in his frustrations. Either way, it would be embarrassing if he had to rely on her help after he boldly proclaimed that he’d save the day. But maybe it was time to force something to happen. 
        In another burst of magic, Ren popped out of his hiding to fire dozens of blasts at the monsters, taking out a good few of them with his bangs. The monsters immediately charged at him, scrambling to tear him to pieces. They all only tore into thin air as they caught his clones and illusions while he jumped up through the air and on top of them to evade the attacks. Laughing all the way. 
        He wanted to see exactly where they’d keep coming from. More of them still came from the forest and some of them had weird bits of purple magic coming off of them. So very strange. Those ones seemed to be the tougher ones too and a couple of ideas started flowing through his head. These things weren’t from this world. That much was for certain, but where exactly? The Far Realm? They did seem like that sort of otherworldly, but they did have some hint of feyness to them. Just the ugly corrupted kind. Still, there had to be something else. 
        His thoughts were interrupted as the last of his magic reserves finally depleted and his clones stopped manifesting. He did his best to evade the attacks, but the sheer number just grew too much as one of them finally did slash him in the back and then another knocked him to the ground. They were on him in seconds, massive mandible jaws snapping at him in a threat to tear out his throat. 
        But he took out his dagger and locked it inside one of the beasts’ jaw and angled it to block the other monsters from reaching him. The very aggressive and temporary barrier wasn’t going to last long, though, and Ren actually did have fear start creeping in his heart. No, he always felt that fear. The only difference was that his mask had finally started to fall off. 
        “Ugh, alright! If you can still hear me, I can really use your help right now. I mean it! Aurora!”
        Every single monster in the clearing, in their rabid movements, froze. A dark blue, soft smelling mist covered the area in seconds as the Archfey arrived. The monsters that were on top of Ren were flung off him from some invisible force and promptly disintegrated in a burst of stardust. Lady Aurora in her majestic and mystical form stood tall over the changeling’s prone form, giving him a glance as his wounds healed from the magic. 
        The rest of the monsters were then captured by tree roots that burst from the grounds and dragged down beneath the surface, their screams silenced in an instant. The Archfey’s dark eyes barely even gave them a glance. And Ren slowly brought himself back onto his feet. “Dear lord, couldn’t you have done that earlier?”
        “You said you could handle it.”
        “Yeah, yeah, that’s on me. Thanks for the save, anyways. And, uhh, I don’t know. I looked for that artifact and it really is hidden well. Though I don’t think even the monsters know where it is. Seemed like they were sniffing for it too.”
        “Likely because there is no artifact.”
        “Huh?”
        “Something is bridging a connection to my realm and it isn’t an artifact. This all but confirms those suspicions.”
        “Wait, you didn’t even know if it actually was an artifact?”
        “Believe it or not, Renedere, but there are things in this world that even I am not certain of. There are items in this world made to counter very powerful beings, but such items are rare. Most of which are only spoken of in legends and manifested through muddled imagination. Such an artifact that’s able to connect dimensional borders can exist, but not the kind that can bypass the border controlled by a supreme being. Not even the Gate spell, the greatest feat of dimensional magic known to man, can achieve such a thing.”
        “Heh, fair enough. But if it’s not an artifact, then what can it be then?”
        Lady Aurora stayed quiet, having wondered this for the past several days. She had scoured through every bit of knowledge she knew, questioning the properties of a Domain of Delight, and finally narrowed it down to only one possible reason. And yet, she wished she could deny it. “Me.”
        “You?”
        “A Domain of Delight is intimately connected to the Archfey that created it. So much so to the point that its landscape is shaped according to their emotions. A mere thought can change the design. A mere sway from joy to sadness can cause devastating rainfall when it was calmingly bright only moments ago. Archfey can be volatile and so can their domains. Any change that happens to an Archfey will be reflected within their domain.”
        “Meaning…”
        “The reason why I have been able to isolate myself and my domain for so long was because I believed I had nothing left for me in this world. My past actions have riddled my conscience with guilt and shame. After thirsting for the powers granted in becoming a deity, working with dark forces, sacrificing a species, unleashing a plague that threatened to destroy my people, and losing the only being I held dear to me…I wished only to atone by locking myself in solitude. My heart grew cold and nothing tethered me to the Feywild, so my domain lay dormant and hidden from anything.
        But then, you came along. You and your sister. Children. Animals. But creatures that I cared for. That I saved. I…perhaps I have grown attached to you…things. A change that brought warmth back to my heart and with the change I was tethered back to this realm. And now my domain no longer has walls to keep invaders out. Ridiculous, isn't it? This change is only temporary. This tether will only last a few years before you both are lost to me too.”
        “Wow…you finally admit that you love us!”
        “I meant no such thing. Only that I’ve foolishly grown an attachment to pets.”
        “Yeah, yeah, keep saying that. Either way I guess that makes sense, but I still don’t see how we can stop the monsters from coming in.”
        The Queen sighed, “I simply must lose my attachments again.”
        “Woah, hang on, that doesn’t mean killing me right?”
        “No. I didn’t save your life just to kill you.”
        “Phew. So then, what do you mean by losing your attachments?”
        “I’ll need to take more drastic measures to isolate my domain. Perhaps I should’ve done this the first time. If I am to fully atone, I must lock my world so deep into the void that…No creature can ever find me.”
        “…what about Faye?”
        “It seems that our departure will need to come early. You may take your sister under your custody. You’ll finally have your time together.”
        Ren shook his head, “Is running away seriously your solution to everything? Come on. You said it yourself that you’re attached to us now. Are you really okay with leaving us now?”
        “It will happen sooner or later anyways.”
        “Yeah, well, not to us. We may be a blip in your life, but to us…to Faye. You’ve been her world. And whether you like it or not, you are her mother!”
        “She's of age. She has no need of a mother anymore.”
        “Yes, she does! Faye already lost her original parents. In fact, she knows almost nothing about them. And I don’t wish for her to know that kind of pain. Why does she need to lose you anyways? You don’t actually want to leave. You don’t actually want to abandon her. I know you don’t.”
        “This is for the best.”
        “Screw the best! I don’t want to lose a friend either.”
        The Archfey turned to look at him and he raised a hand towards her. “Yeah, that’s right. In spite of all your cold self righteous bullshit, I see you as a friend. Because no matter how wild and stupid my antics can get at the end of the day you still help me out.” He smirked, “That’s why you gave me my magic in the first place, right?
        Logic is for archdevils. But emotions are what truly define an Archfey. So, stop trying to hide how you feel and just do what you really want, Aurora. You’re more emotional than you think, and it’s not a bad thing to care. It’s okay to love. Even when you’re afraid to lose.
        Everyone goes through this and living longer than most doesn’t change that. It’s not about how long we have with the people we love, it’s about the kind of time we spend with them. Years being around people that you barely talk to will feel like seconds that pass by, but the moments we spend really caring for the people around us will feel like decades. It’s why I’m trying to make up for all the time I missed with Faye. Think, Aurora. Think about all the time you’ve spent with her. All those years that you spent together. I bet Faye thinks about them all the time. What about you?”
        Wish Upon A Star
        A young Faye giggled as Lady Aurora whisked her up in the air with a bit of magic. Stardust swirled around the little girl as she swung her arms and spun around. The girl had asked her about her magic and what other sort of things the Archfey could do and something compelled her to demonstrate. Words alone would not be enough to show her soon-to-be talented protege the glories that can be achieved with her kind of magic. 
        However, lifting Faye up into the air was not necessary. So, why did she think it appropriate? The girl continued to giggle, “Mother! Please! This is too much, set me down!”
        “Do you wish me to? You seem to be quite enjoying it.”
        “I do! But I don’t know how to fly!”
        “Set your fears aside, dear. Your safety is ensured. But you wanted to know what magic is capable of doing, and so this is merely one example. Even creatures without wings can learn to touch the stars.”
        The girl’s eyes opened up to marvel at her groundless feet and then up at the sky with the widest smile. She continued to laugh and the Archfey continued to stare at her joyous expression. Her face did not have a mouth, and thus could not show a smile. And yet, those that could see her face would see a bright glint in her eye. 
        A boy ran up to them and jumped up and down at Lady Aurora’s feet. “No fair! Make me fly too!”
        The Archfey looked down at the child. “Renedere. You may not be capable of magic, but that doesn’t mean I haven’t taught you any.”
        The boy looked at her in confusion before something clicked in his head. “Oh! Um, please?”
        At that moment, the young Renedere was lifted up into the air with a flick of Aurora’s fifth wrist. The two children danced in the air as the magic of the Archfey coalesced in a bright nightshow. 
        In the past millennia, her “heart” failed to beat. Surrounded by the cold darkness of a night she created. No fire of ambition nor love ever burned in so long. But this moment, alongside the moments when the two children slept under her wing, was when she finally felt a beat. She told herself several times that this meant nothing. That they were merely injured animals that she would nurse back to health so that they can go and survive in the wild. But that was not all they were anymore. 
        Queen of the Stars Above
        Lady Aurora turned to stare at Renedere, the full grown adventurer standing before her. “You’re right…”
        The man blinked. “You agree?”
        The Archfey slouched, the rest of her facade shattering. “Maybe it’s time I’ve been honest with myself as well.” Shaking her head, “And to think a mortal was the one to tell me so.”
        “Well, I’m no mere mortal~”
        “Hiding myself away has done nothing to correct my mistakes. Perhaps it is time I was as brave as you are. Time that I stopped being so passive.” More of the rotting monsters crawled back out of the forest, somehow multiplying even more to surround them. Lady Aurora’s voice grew graver as she spoke. “If I cannot prevent the world from invading my home, then it is time that I show the world the consequences of their actions.”
        “Woah, what are you going—” Ren’s sentence was cut off as he felt a rumble of the ground and stumbled to keep his balance. He looked back to see Lady Aurora, but the Archfey had disappeared. 
        Everything turned black as a vision crossed into Lady Aurora’s galaxy-filled eyes. Suddenly, her domain zoomed out further and further until the entire world was in view. Then the Material Realm. Then more and more until a galaxy was in sight. Space and stars swirled around in a dark void with billions of planets in sight. 
        A large purple eye symbol formed that towered over the sight, opening up to gaze at the universe. Hands formed from the space and stars as they held the galaxy up to the eye before clenching into a fist, creating a bright light that filled the vision in a big bang. 
        Back in the Sleeping Forest, chaos had enveloped the entire domain. Ren found himself watching the sight from what seemed like another void as he saw the Archfey in her most terrifying form. This was the moment he fully realized why she was called the Queen of the Stars Above. 
        A giant celestial moth queen stood tall as her wings consisted of the entire starry sky. The stars flashed as beams upon beams of cascading starlight flew down to scorch every single monster that dared step foot into the forest in a fiery rainfall of calculated attacks. However, her sights were set on the very source of these intruders. Though that man was out of reach, there were ways to stop his petty meddling. 
        Her gaze pierced into the very beings of the creatures, taking note of their magical makeup, and created a new magical defense that eradicated these types of creatures immediately. The change would require a complete reconstruction of the domain, but it was an effort worth spending, especially if it meant the safety of her wards. For she was no longer protecting her forest to simply hide away, but to defend her most cherished. They will come to fear the searing wrath of a mother’s love. 
        The Future
        Soon after the epic spectacle, Ren found himself standing in the clearing of their childhood home and Lady Aurora back in her usual form. He almost felt unsettled at how much he annoyed her in the past, and yet now she seemed to always show him some mercy. He appreciated that. 
        “Holy baloney, you could do that the whole time?!”
        “Every Archbeing is capable of similar feats, but I’d have preferred not to resort to such extensive use of magic. Doing so has lit a beacon to the rest of the world to my presence.”
        “Well, it sends a message at least. That was plan B, right?”
        “Indeed. I should have some time at least to finish repairing Galaseer.”
        “So, we’re good? The day’s been saved?”
        “For now. The monsters will no longer be able to enter the realm, least not without instant annihilation. I expect that whoever is sending them will realize this and pause their arrival soon.”
        “Do you know who is sending these monsters?”
        “I do. But it isn’t just him. There’s something else that’s been affecting these creatures. The monsters are weak, but these numbers and their adaptive strength seems foreign to even where they originally came from. And these properties are beyond that man’s capabilities.”
        “You’re saying he’s working with something else?”
        “Possibly, it wouldn’t be out of character for him to work with powerful beings. However, something just doesn’t feel right about that. He works primarily with necromancy and fey magic. This magic has…far more aberrant features.”
        “Well, either way, what do we gotta do to stop this bozo?”
        “Nothing.”
        “What?”
        “He’s beyond this world and thus out of my reach. I can try to locate him, but he has defenses to evade my gaze and even if I do know where he is I have no interest in hunting his pitiful corpse.”
        “So, you’re just gonna let him get away with this?”
        “As of right now, there is nothing I can do. I’ve already won my battle. Anything more is no longer my fight.”
        “And here I thought you said you were going to be more proactive.”
        “There’s a difference between being passive and choosing which battles to fight. I will not be so reckless as to waste my efforts on something so petty. Besides, I’m sure we’re going to have many more guests that I’ll need to attend to. The Courts do not take kindly to poor hosts.”
        “Yikes, I’m not sure if that’s a party I want to be around for.” Ren thought for a moment before speaking up again, “Speaking of, what was all that about all your past mistakes? Something about becoming a deity?”
        The Archfey visibly stiffened before looking up at the sky. “That’s a long tale.”
        “Eh, my legs are still sore.” He plopped down on the ground. “I’ve got all day.”
        “I…did have one friend once. A charming young elven girl that belonged to the Summer Court. Princess Xipe of the Brightest Dreams. At the time I was aligned with the Winter Court, so our interactions were few and far between. However, from the day we first met and every moment afterwards with her always did feel like a dream. We both were among the lesser known fey with her being a simple fey and I an Archfey that preferred the shadows, but we still had fruitful chats. All sorts of interests from different animal species, the dreams that we found, and I even taught her how to read the stars.”
        “Were you two, like, a thing?”
        She breathed out an amused sigh, “As I have told you, I would not be so foolish. But in another time, perhaps. We both held a special interest in dreams and theorized about a possible way to make reality into a paradise full of everyone’s dreams come true. I wanted to make that dream come true for her, in which case I’d be able to spend more time with her. I was invited to the Summer Court, mind you, but I would never have dared to betray the Queen of Air and Darkness.”
        “Soooo, is this when becoming a god comes in?”
        “I figured it would all be worth it in the end. My ambition blinded me, however, just as it did to many of the best souls. I went through the path that would give me what I wanted. The power to gain complete dominance over the concept of dreams.”
        “You wanted to become the Goddess of Dreams?”
        “Yes, and that required working with a mage to devise something that could drain the magical energy of dreams from creatures.”
        “How did you manage…” His eyes widened. “Draining magic. You’re not talking about the Colorless Plague are you?” 
        “The Colorless Plague wasn’t the method devised for that, but…it was a byproduct.”
        “How did you accidentally cause a fucking pandemic???”
        “The original virus was supposed to just be a curse that killed Vaahzim and extracted their magic energy, which due to their natural hunger for dreams would already have dream energy in them. However, I should have known that the mage would have further plans for the curse.”
        “Damn…you know that explains a lot actually. I know I’d definitely lock myself in a dark room forever if I caused a genocide.”
        “The ritual didn’t even work in the end. In the height of the plague, I figured I’d be able to stop it once I completed my ascension…but everything comes at a cost. And a god’s power would be far graver than anything imaginable.”
        “Is that how your friend died?”
        “There’s a lot about gods that not even I fully understand. But what I learned that day was that once you ascend to godhood, the truth is it isn’t you that becomes a god. Every god in this world represents a primordial concept, concepts that have existed from the beginning of all creation. Those concepts are just that, concepts with no personality or conscience. When a creature becomes a god, they become their concept. They do not dominate their concept, their concept dominates them. If I were to become the Goddess of Dreams, then I would no longer be the Queen of Stars. I would only be dreams.”
        “But you’re not, so…”
        “I did not ascend. But the ritual had already started and the world was already out of balance. Someone needed to restore the natural order and put an end to the plague, and my friend…Xipe. She knew what I wanted to do, what I couldn’t bring myself to do. Finish what I had started.”
        Ren stayed quiet for a long while as an awkward silence took over. At a loss for words, before eventually he had to cough and clear his throat. “Wow, that’s…yeah, okay.”
        “And now you understand my shame.”
        “I guess, but was locking yourself in solitude really the best way to make up for it?”
        “Perhaps not.”
        “Yeah, look, all that happened back then was way before I was even born, so in all honesty I can’t judge you too harshly for it. Maybe I would if I was actually directly affected by it, but I’m not. I mean, I’ve definitely made a lot of mistakes, but I can’t say its close to mass genocide.
        Still, I don’t think you’re a bad person. You’ve saved my life twice now, thrice if you count giving me magic. You took care of my sister, and that’s enough to earn my gratitude for several lifetimes. Since you feel so remorseful, maybe doing more of those acts of kindness could go a long way to making up for it, you know?”
        “I shall think on it.” The Archfey shut her eyes and took a deep breath, releasing more mystical dust to scatter throughout the forest and start healing the life around. “Thank you, Renedere. For staying to help me…even after all that I have said and done.”
        “Hey, it’s no problem. I mean, it’s like you taught us: Never take things at face value.”
        “It may seem that I’ve underestimated how much you truly learned.”
        “We may live short lives, but we sure do a lot in that time.”
        “Yes, and even in these centuries I still have much to learn.”
        “Being alone and doing nothing wouldn’t give much room for any new experiences, I’d say.”
        “True, but I haven’t been doing nothing.” Lady Aurora raised her hand in the air and shifted the stars to reveal what looked like a sight into the Material Realm’s starry sky. “I’ve been tracking the stars over the years. Taking note of signs. It’s how I’ve learned so much about the future.”
        “So, you knew all this was going to happen?”
        “Crystal clear visions of the future are impossible, given how the slightest choices can change them. However, there are events that are so big and inevitable that they can leave noticeable impacts in the star’s movements. I did know something significant was going to happen, so I was prepared for it. It’s also a part of the reason why I enrolled Faye at Strixhaven, instead of a university within our realm. That way she would be off world when it happens, and safe.”
        “You did all that and you were still denying that you cared about her?”
        “Emotions can often blind you of how you feel. Either way, in my excess of time, I’ve been tracking the stars. Such has been my duty as the Queen of the Stars Above, along with exploring the dream world to study the dreams of mortals. A task that used to belong to Xipe, but after she ascended her purpose was passed to me. Her last act.”
        “Well, isn’t that beautiful?”
        “Personally, I consider it her getting back at me for meddling in her domain so much. Though she did know how much I adored the dreams that danced under the stars' gaze.” After a brief moment of reminiscing, Lady Aurora straightened her demeanor and looked at Ren. “That should be all for now. If you have no other business, you should see Faye and let her know what has transpired. I still have much to attend to, so unfortunately, I won’t be able to tell her myself.”
        “Heh, I’d take any excuse to go see my dear sister. Mind if you give me a ride?”
        Lady Aurora’s eyes glinted with slight amusement and she raised her hand to create the portal. However, right as she was in the middle of the movements, something made her pause as her gaze had lifted up to the stars.
        “That’s strange. The stars that signaled that something big was going to happen haven't changed.”
        “Huh?”
        “I had assumed that destiny was the reconstruction of my domain, but if they're still showing that omen then...”
        “That means that big event hasn’t happened yet?”
        Her eyes narrowed, “Of course, they wouldn’t be so specific. These stars belong to the world’s sky, which would mean…” Her eyes widened, “This event will affect the entire world.”
        Right as she said that, the sky rumbled with a loud crack and thunder. The both of them followed the direction of that sound and watched the sky turn a dark purple as large spirals opened up through the stars. A piercing spider-web crack had broken the sky and a bright purple glow lit up the night’s darkness. Lady Aurora’s eyes reflected the incoming disaster. 
        Ren was the first to say something. “Something tells me that’s the world event.”
